# DrawShapes 
### Now with tracing feature!
 This software gives the user the ability to draw a variety of shapes, trace a picture of their choice, save and load previous projects, and save a capture of what they drew.


### How to Use:
#### DRAWING TOOLS:
##### Elipse
    make a point in the center of where you want you elipse to be. 
    make a point at the first radius length (width).
    make a point at the second radius length (height).
##### Line 
    Make two points anywhere in the drawing area.
##### Bezier Curve 
    Make four points anywhere in the drawing area. 
##### Triangle 
    Make three points anywhere in the drawing area. 
##### Circle 
    The first point you make is the center of the circle. 
    the second point will complete the circle by using the line you created between the two points as the radius. 
##### Rectangle 
    Make a point on the top left-hand side you want your rectangle to start. 
    Make a second point at the bottom right-hand side where you want the rectangle to end.

    Hitting the save button will save a png file of the drawing area to the project location. 
##### Free Draw
    Hitting the free draw button will pop up a width slider that you can use to pick the width of your line. 
    Once you are done drawing hit the close button that pops up under the free line button
